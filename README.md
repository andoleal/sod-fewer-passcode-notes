# Description: 

This mod reduces the number of passcode notes by 60% when the game generates a city. This makes the game more realistic and makes codebreakers more useable.

One thing that bugs me about the base game is that nearly every citizen writes down their passcode. You never ever worry about not having a passcode because it's always around on a note. According to Google, in real life only 38% of people write down their passwords. This mod brings the number of notes closer to that value.
